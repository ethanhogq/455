## Technology Usage (Incomplete)

### Unit 1

CSS, JavaScript and HTML are all being utilized in various areas of this projects, with `index.html` as the entry point of this project, CSS for the styling of components and JavaScript to form the individual components in React as well as composing the backend of this project. 

### Unit 2: React

React forms the backbone of the projects. We have used multiple React technologies to enhance our functionalities. `useState` to maintain data consistency between editing modal, journal entry and screens containing these entries. `createContext` to provide multiple components with authentication info, enabling conditional rendering and token to access information in database. 

### Unit 3: Node and Express

### Unit 4: MongoDB

### Unit 5: Release Engineering

In order to ensure users can access their information everywhere, we have hosted our website in Heroku. In Heroku, we have made use of the `Secrets` function to hide API access tokens and keys from the codebase. We have also delegated the burden to continuous deployment to **GitHub Actions,** so that changes made to the `master` branch will be applied to the website within minutes.
