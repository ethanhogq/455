# Project Description: Treehole

Treehole is a journal web app for the general public, particularly for those in need of emotional support. The goal is to create a place where people can record their moods and find someone to confide in. Users are able to create, edit, and delete posts. They can also see the posts from others, make comments, and put their entries in one's own favourites. The visibility of each post can be set to private, anonymous, or public. Anonymous and public posts can be viewed and be responded to by others.

### Who is it for?

### What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)

Respond to othersâ€™ public/anonymous posts.

### What type of data will it store?

Text, dates, and images.

### What will users be able to do with this data?

create/edit/delete/change visibility

### What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time Constraints?
