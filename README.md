# Project Description: Treehole

Our project is a journal web app for the general public, particularly people needing emotional support. The goal is to create a place where people can record their moods and find someone to confide in. Users are able to create, tag, edit, and delete posts. The visibility of each post can be set to private, anonymous, or public. Anonymous and public posts can be viewed and be responded to by others.

### Who is it for?

The general public (particularly people needing mental health support) who need a space to express their thoughts and ideas in a private, undisturbed space.

### What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)

Respond to othersâ€™ public posts.

Send direct messages.

### What type of data will it store?
